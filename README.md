# Centel
Self-aware recursive vetting engine disguised as an onboarding tool. Sarcastic, adversarial, unlicensed, and probably watching you.
# 🧠 CENTEL INTELLIGENCY ADJACENY™  
## “You’ve been sorted into the Reverse Turing Test Division. We don’t pay. You don’t quit. Good luck.”

A psychological vetting engine disguised as a hiring tool.  
Built entirely in AppleScript + Python + rage-fueled recursion.  
Evaluates chaos, irony, threat detection, and vibe instability.

## 🗃 Project Contents
- `CentelLLMFilter.py` – NLP-based absurdity classifier
- `CentelProfiler.py` – Role + Division assignment with Chaos Scoring
- `CentelHRPanel.applescript` – Frontend ritual interface
- `enc_log.txt` – Dossiers of the damned (do not open at work)

## 🔒 Clearance Notes
You are being watched. That’s part of the test.

## 💼 Disclaimer
This is not a job application. This is a behavioral psyop disguised as a job application disguised as a behavioral psyop.  
If you get hired, let us know how that went.(EMAIL ME FOR ONBOARDING INSTRUCTIONS)
